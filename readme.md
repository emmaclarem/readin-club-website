## About

This is a static website homepage for a recreational club, made as part of Codecademy's Frontend Engineer Career Path. I'm an avid reader and love chatting about books, so I chose to create a made-up book club called Read'in.

This was a completely solo project, with only rough guidance and no starter code from Codecademy. 100% designed and coded by me.

## Objective
**From Codecademy:** In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​ Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned.

## Project Requirements
- [x] Title / logo / splash image / hero section
- [x] An 'About' section briefly describing the club
- [x] A section describing how people can join the club
- [x] A testimonial(s) section
- [x] Incorporate media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen
- [x] Use percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, to size and position page elements.

## What I Learned
1. Using percentages and max-width to set a responsive layout
2. Using rem and em to set font sizes, paddings, and margins responsively
3. Experimenting with organizing CSS by type instead of page area
4. How to set a smooth scroll effect
5. How to make a fixed 'back to top' button, and how to have it in the center of the screen at any size
6. Creating a button click animation effect 
7. Using FontAwesome icons
